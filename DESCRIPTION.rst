Akamai CCU REST API
===================

Implementation of the Akamai CCU REST API as described 
`here <https://api.ccu.akamai.com/ccu/v2/docs/index.html>`_

Hat tip to these Projects for inspiration/code:

* https://github.com/dryan/python-ccuapi
* https://github.com/beathan/django-akamai

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple "What's New" section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
